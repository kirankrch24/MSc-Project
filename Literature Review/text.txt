Energy consumption analysis plays a crucial role in understanding energy use dynamics and informing policy development. This project addresses a gap in the literature concerning energy consumption trends in Scottish council areas between 2005 and 2020 by analyzing and visualizing data from open-source repositories provided by the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Scottish Government. The study focuses on domestic, commercial, and public sectors, exploring variations in energy usage within specific geographic locations.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, followed by the creation of a customized, interactive dashboard using Power BI to enable a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns and trends. Various machine learning models, such as linear regression, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and ensemble methods, will be explored to identify the most suitable model for predicting energy consumption, with model selection guided by cross-validation and evaluation metrics.

The selected machine learning model will be deployed using Flask and Postman, creating a simple, lightweight, and flexible RESTful API. By filling the existing gaps in the literature and providing valuable insights, this project aims to contribute to the understanding of energy consumption trends in Scottish council areas from 2005 to 2020 and support future policy development and decision-making.
