In conclusion, there exists a gap in the analysis and visualization of energy consumption data in Scottish council areas for the period between 2005 and 2020. To address this gap, I will be utilizing open-source energy consumption data provided by the Scottish Government, focusing on data from 2005 to 2013 due to its availability. I will be conducting my exploratory data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook, owing to my familiarity with the language and the vast range of available tools and libraries for data analysis and visualization tasks.

When it comes to dashboard creation, I have chosen to use Power BI due to its seamless integration with other Microsoft products, user-friendly interface, and cost-effectiveness. For predictive modeling of energy consumption data, I will be considering various machine learning techniques such as linear regression, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, and ensemble methods, evaluating them based on cross-validation and appropriate evaluation metrics to select the most suitable model for the task.

Lastly, to deploy the machine learning model, I will utilize Flask and Postman for their simplicity, ease of use, and extensive documentation. This combination will allow me to create RESTful APIs and conveniently test and validate the API endpoints without writing additional code.
