In conclusion, the literature review has revealed several gaps in the existing research on energy consumption analysis, particularly with respect to the exploration and modeling of energy consumption data in the context of Scottish council areas from 2005 to 2020. The available sources and publications do not focus specifically on the council areas or cover the exact period specified for this project.

To address these gaps, this project will involve conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on energy consumption data in Scottish council areas during the specified period using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This choice is driven by the language's versatility, readability, and the abundance of tools and libraries available for data analysis and visualization tasks.

Additionally, Power BI has been chosen as the preferred tool for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations due to its ease of use, seamless integration with other Microsoft products, and cost-effectiveness. This will enable the integration of the generated dashboard into a PowerPoint presentation for easy reporting and presentation.

To select the most suitable predictive model for energy consumption analysis, multiple machine learning techniques will be explored and compared, including linear regression, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and ensemble methods. The choice of the best method will be guided by cross-validation and domain knowledge, taking into account various evaluation metrics and criteria, such as R-squared, mean squared error, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.

This project aims to fill the identified gaps in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption data in Scottish council areas and developing an accurate and robust predictive model for future energy consumption. By critically examining the evaluation metrics, the context, and the existing research, this project will contribute valuable insights to the field of energy consumption analysis and modeling.
