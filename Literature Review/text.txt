As global energy demand continues to grow, there is an increasing need for sustainable energy management and efficient decision-making processes to reduce the environmental and economic impact of energy consumption. In the Scottish council area, optimizing energy use and understanding the factors influencing energy consumption patterns have become essential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving resources.

This project aims to address the knowledge gap in the literature concerning energy consumption trends in Scottish council areas between 2005 and 2020. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, this study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the energy consumption patterns and types of fuels consumed across domestic, commercial, and public sectors. Through the analysis of data from open-source repositories provided by the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Scottish Government, the project seeks to uncover valuable insights that can drive targeted improvements and optimization efforts.

The project will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Jupyter Notebook to identify trends and patterns in energy consumption. Subsequently, an interactive business intelligence dashboard will be developed using Power BI, enabling stakeholders to visualize and analyze energy consumption data effectively. Various machine learning models, such as linear regression, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and ensemble methods, will be employed to develop accurate predictive models for energy consumption, with model selection guided by cross-validation and evaluation metrics.

Finally, the selected machine learning model will be deployed using Flask and Postman, creating a simple, lightweight, and flexible RESTful API. This project not only aims to contribute to the understanding of energy consumption trends in Scottish council areas but also supports future policy development and decision-making to foster sustainable development and a greener future for Scotland and beyond.
